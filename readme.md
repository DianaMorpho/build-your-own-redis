# Build Your Own X - Redis(using Go)

I found a tutorial collection on GitHub called [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file). I chose to build my own Redis because I have used Redis in the past and I am interested in how it works. I know it's a single threaded high performance in memory key-value store.

But unfortunately, the [tutorial](https://www.build-redis-from-scratch.dev/en/introduction) building it using Go is kind of shallow. It only implements some basic commands and doesn't touch on the more advanced features of Redis. I didn't finish the data persistence part because it also looks shallow and easy.
